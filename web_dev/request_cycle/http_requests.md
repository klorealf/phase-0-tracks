	HTTP: POST requests supply additional data from the client (browser) to the server in the message body. POST - Submits data to be processed to a specified resource
	In contrast, GET requests include all required data in the URL. Forms in HTML can use either method by specifying method="POST" or method="GET" (default) in the <form> element. GET - Requests data from a specified resource

What is a cookie (the technical kind, not the delicious kind)? How does it relate to HTTP requests?
	 An HTTP cookie (web cookie, browser cookie) is a small piece of data that a server sends to the user's web browser, that may store it and send it back together with the next request to the same server. Typically. it is used to know if two requests came from the same browser allowing to keep a user logged-in, for example. It remembers stateful information for the stateless HTTP protocol.
