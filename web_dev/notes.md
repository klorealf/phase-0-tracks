Plan:
See what's generally possible (table of contents in W3Schools?)
See it in action (find a good YouTube introduction)
Find the docs and a cheatsheet
Do all the things to a couple of divs

Worked:
The W3Schools jquery selector tool was really cool for learning syntax
DevTips on youtube had a 15 minute intro to JQuery, a little too fast, but game me some good ideas
The jQuery docs are good, but the table of contents isn't descriptive enough to find what you want
Probably just familiarity with the site, but I found W3Schools reference easier to navigate
There's really nothing like just playing around in your browser
